= Trading Rules and Dispute Resolution
:imagesdir: images
:!figure-caption:

Follow these rules to make your trades smooth and successful, and be aware of the tools available if you end up with issues.

To trade on Bisq, you assume one of two roles, no matter what national currency or cryptocurrency you're trading: you either buy bitcoin or sell bitcoin.

This document covers the rules and expectations for both roles, as well as details on the process for handling disputes.

== Trading Rules

Whether making or taking an offer, bitcoin sellers put all the bitcoin they're selling in the multisig escrow transaction, so there's less for them to do and fewer rules they need to follow.

The rules below are _default_ rules for every transaction. Offer makers sometimes specify their own _additional_ terms for handling/arranging payments. For example, a seller using cash deposit might require a picture of a receipt torn in half with "NO REFUND" written on it. Face-to-face traders often specify terms about where and how to meet. Make sure you're okay with an offer-maker's terms **before** you accept an offer!

=== Bitcoin Sellers

Bitcoin sellers _must_:

- **Click `Confirm payment` after receiving payment**
+
Sellers have until the end of the maximum trade period to do so.
+
Please don't get impatient if a buyer doesn't send payment immediately. Although buyers are encouraged to send payment as soon as possible, they can take length of the trade period to do so.

- **Collaborate with mediators and arbitrators**
+
In case of a dispute, users must respond to inquiries within 48 hours and providing materials as requested to determine an outcome.
+
Mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.

Bitcoin sellers _may_:

- **Respond to trader chat messages**
+
This is optional. Please see the <<#trader-chat, rules for trader chat>> below.

Bitcoin sellers _should not_:

- **Communicate with buyers away from Bisq**
+
Using email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is discouraged. The <<#trader-chat, trader chat>> feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader's chat messages indicate they broke a rule).

=== Bitcoin Buyers

WARNING: To avoid unexpected issues, make sure you can actually carry out a payment with the payment method you've set up in Bisq. Examples: Wells Fargo doesn't allow cash deposits into bank accounts not owned by the depositor, and Zelle has weekly and monthly transfer maximums that are easy to overlook. The software will warn you about known issues, but cannot possibly keep up with all the newest banking and money transfer rules.

Bitcoin buyers _must_:

- **Make payment reasonably early within trade period**
+
Buyer should complete at a time such that the seller has enough time to acknowledge receipt of the payment before the trade period is over. Waiting until the very end of the trade period to make a payment is not advised, as then the seller cannot reasonably act in time to acknowledge receipt (also, it's annoying). The https://bisq.network/faq/#trade-periods[lengths of trade periods^] vary based on payment method.

- **Make payment from account used to make or take the offer**
+
Intermediary banks or other payment methods from the same bank are not acceptable. Account information (e.g., name, account number, etc) of the account used to make the payment must _exactly_ match the information in the Bisq payment account details.
+
If such a payment cannot be made, please communicate the issue through trader chat, or you'll need to make your case to a mediator or arbitrator.

- **Enter the trade ID in payment's "reason for payment"**
+
If possible, the trade ID should be included in the payment's "reason for payment" field. The name of this field can vary by payment method; some call it "Message" or "Information for recipient" or similar. Pick the field (if available) that enables the user to tie the payment to the specific trade.
+
If there us no such field, just send the payment without specifying the trade ID.

- **Click `Payment started` after sending payment**
+
Seller cannot mark payment as received until buyer confirms that they have sent it. Don't forget!

- **Pay any transaction fees**
+
Any fees incurred to make the payment via the agreed payment method (e.g., bank fees for bank transfer, money-order fees for money orders, etc) are the buyer's responsibility to pay.
+
The seller should receive the _exact_ amount of the trade. The only exception to this rule is if the receiving institution imposes a fee on incoming payments—these fees are borne by the seller.

- **Collaborate with mediators and arbitrators**
+
In case of a dispute, users must respond to inquiries within 48 hours and providing materials as requested to determine an outcome.
+
Mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to messages, and arbitrators may take up to 5 days to respond to messages.

Bitcoin buyers _may_:

- **Respond to trader chat messages**
+
This is optional. Please see the <<#trader-chat, rules for trader chat>> below.

Bitcoin buyers _should not_:

- **Add any additional information in payment's "reason for payment"**
+
Any mentions of _Bisq_ or _Bitcoin_ or any text other than the trade ID is prohibited. The receiver is already expecting a payment from you using the agreed payment method in the amount of the trade, so there is no reason to reveal any more context or information.

WARNING: This is an important rule, and potentially a serious problem if broken: many banks don't like anything related to Bitcoin, and may create serious problems for you (or your trading peer) if they sense such a transacton.

- **Communicate with buyers away from Bisq**
+
Using email addresses, phone numbers, and other means to contact traders is strongly discouraged. The <<#trader-chat, trader chat>> feature built into Bisq should be used instead: not only is it more private, but the chat record can more easily be made available to mediators and arbitrators (useful in case a trader's chat messages indicate they broke a rule).

=== Face-to-Face (F2F) Trading
[[f2f-trading]]

On Bisq, F2F trades are _technically_ very similar to online trades. In fact, to carry out a F2F trade, you follow the same process within the Bisq software as you would for any other trade. The difference is in how the buyer pays the seller: instead of paying through a financial intermediary (like a bank or other money transfer service), the buyer meets the seller in real life and pays with cash.

This introduces some important _practical_ differences. The rules above still apply, but keep in mind the suggestions and guidelines below.

==== Meeting your trading partner

Doing a transaction face-to-face means you'll be coming within close proximity of a stranger to exchange relatively substantial value.

===== Be safe

People do local, in-person commerce all the time, all over the world. Incidents are rare, but they do happen. You should be cognizant of risks and do your part to minimize potential harm.

**Guard your data.** When you set up a face-to-face payment account in Bisq, you'll need to provide contact information so you can arrange a meeting with your trading partner. Make sure this information isn't traceable back to your property or identity.

**Meet in a neutral public place.** Meeting your trading partner in a place with witnesses and security cameras significantly reduces the chance of an incident.

**Don't bring more than you need.** Even in a public place, incidents can still happen, but you can limit the chance even further by limiting valuables on your person that would interest a thief in the first place.

**Bring backup.** Consider bringing a friend with you. Also, depending on the laws in your area & your own comfort, consider carrying a concealed tool for self-defense. Even pepper-spray can hobble a criminal just enough to get you out of immediate danger.

===== Validate payment

Face-to-face trades are usually settled with cash. Cash is wonderfully anonymous, but it can be counterfeited. Be sure you know the basics of detecting counterfeit currency. For example, there are several characteristics of US dollar bills one can examine to quickly determine fakes with high accuracy.

You could look for tools like counterfeit pens to do the work for you, but make sure you do thorough research before picking one. Counterfeit pens, for example, are often not reliable.

If you'd rather not take the chance of carrying or accepting cash, consider meeting at a bank where you can validate a buyer's payment on the spot.

===== Ensure you follow Bisq protocol

Ultimately, the deal will be completed in Bisq. Buyers must mark payment as sent before sellers can release assets.

**Buyers** should bring a laptop with them so they can mark the payment as sent. Otherwise, the buyer will end up paying the seller and have to walk away without the bitcoin they paid for (since the seller won't be able to acknowledge receipt of payment before the buyer acknowledges they sent payment).

**Sellers** should bring a laptop with their Bisq client running no matter what. Once they receive a legitimate payment, they'll need to mark the payment as received so the assets are released to the buyer. No buyer will want to walk away after paying without proof of a complete deal.

==== Disputes

The lack of verifiable actions makes handling face-to-face disputes much harder.

This is why we highly recommend that both parties bring laptops and acknowledge their ends of the deal on the spot.

Otherwise, the same dispute process is in place for F2F trades (<<#face-to-face-f2f-trading, see below>>), but be advised that mediators and arbitrators often won't have a way to settle disputes. This means funds may be held indefinitely, or until both parties can reach an agreement.

Mediators and arbitrators may attempt different tactics to get a handle on the situation. For example, they may ask a potential scammer for ID verification, which is a request a real scammer probably wouldn't comply with.

== Dispute Resolution

Dispute resolution on Bisq has 3 layers: trader chat, mediation, and arbitration.

Until Bisq v1.1.6, arbitration was the only means for traders to handle disputes.

After Bisq v1.1.6, chat and mediation were introduced to handle the vast majority of disputes more efficiently, making arbitration a rare fallback for extreme circumstances.

NOTE: Most issues on Bisq are minor and easily resolved when traders communicate with each other.

=== Trader Chat

Direct end-to-end encrypted chat in Bisq allows traders to communicate with each other throughout the course of a trade to resolve trade issues quickly without involving a third party like a mediator or arbitrator.

This functionality was avoided for a while because of the risky nature of having 2 internet strangers communicate with each other, but we aim to mitigate these risks with the following rules:

- **Responding to chat messages is always optional**
+
If you're not comfortable responding to chat messages, don't respond. You have no obligation to communicate over this medium.

- **Do not send links of any kind**
+
For safety. If you want to send a link, describe it instead.
+
_Not allowed:_
+
`+++https://blockstream.info/tx/4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5+++`
+
_Allowed:_
+
`Hey, could you look up txid 4b5417ec5ab6112bedf539c3b4f5a806ed539542d8b717e1c4470aa3180edce5 in your favorite block explorer?`

- **Do not encourage trading away from Bisq**
+
Trades away from Bisq lack Bisq's security mechanisms. If something goes wrong with an off-Bisq trade, you're on your own.

- **Do not send sensitive information like private keys, passwords, etc**
+
Such information is never wise to share in general, and is _never_ needed to solve trade disputes on Bisq.

- **Do not attempt social engineering exploits**
+
Any attempts to engage in foul play are prohibited.

- **Respect a peer's decision to avoid responding**
+
If a peer seems unresponsive, or has signaled their intention to refrain from chatting, please respect it and don't pressure them.

- **Keep conversation scope limited to the trade**
+
Please don't use Bisq's trader chat as a general-purpose messenger. Unnecessary exchanges add unnecessary strain to Bisq's peer-to-peer network.

- **Keep conversation friendly and respectful**
+
Because friendlier traders resolve disputes quicker, and no one wants to deal with a jerk.

Hopefully, by following these rules, you can work directly with your trading peer to solve issues quickly and amicably.

If not, you may need to engage a mediator.

=== Mediation

[.left.text-center]
.Start mediation.
image::start-mediation.png[Start mediation,400,400]

If trading peers cannot resolve issues on their own with trader chat, mediation is the next step.

==== How Mediation Works

A mediator's job is to evaluate a trade situation between two users and make a _suggestion_ for a payout. Mediators do _not_ have a key in the multisig escrow transaction, so their suggested payout is _not authoritative_.

Trading peers should do their best to cooperate with the mediator and provide the <<#dispute-process-what-to-expect, requested information>>, and are required to respond to messages within 48 hours.

Likewise, **mediators may take up to 48 hours to respond to your messages.** Please don't panic if you don't hear back immediately.

When a mediator suggests a payout:

* if both peers agree with the suggestion, the payout is completed and the trade is closed
* if one or both peers disagree with the suggestion, the situation is then re-evaluated by an arbitrator who makes the payout based on their findings (<<#arbitration, see below>>)

[NOTE]
====
You don't have to wait for the end of a trading period to request help from a mediator. You can engage a mediator at any point during the trading period, for example, if your trading peer's chats make you feel uncomfortable.

But please be patient—for example, it's not against the rules for a buyer to send payment toward the end of the trade period, so engaging a mediator during the trade period (for this reason) would not be productive.
====

==== Who Are Mediators?

Mediator roles are <<user-dao-intro#ensure-honesty-in-high-trust-roles, bonded roles>> in the Bisq DAO. Anyone can propose to become a mediator, but approval will depend on the network's need for more mediators at the time a proposal is made.

Once a proposal to become a mediator is approved by DAO voting, the mediator must lock a 10 000 BSQ bond to become active. This bond helps to ensure their continued availability and performance in the role, and can be confiscated by DAO voting in extreme circumstances (negligence, foul play, prolonged absence, etc).

You can see more details (current role owners, regular updates, etc) on the https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/83[mediator role issue^].

==== Why Mediation?

Mediation is the cornerstone of Bisq's new trade protocol, which seeks to eliminate arbitration. Unlike arbitrators, mediators don't have a key in the multisig escrow transaction, meaning they don't require nearly as much trust. This reduced trust requirement also enables more people to become mediators, so mediation can be made available in more languages to support Bisq trading around the world, allowing dispute resolution to scale more flexibly.

The new trade protocol is being implemented in stages, with trader chat and mediation implemented first in parallel with the existing trade protocol with arbitrators (v1.1.6), before an eventual switchover to a new protocol without arbitrators.

You can learn more about Bisq's future trade protocol in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnTA3p-5v00[this video^]. Please note that the new trade protocol is a work in progress, so final implementation details may change.

=== Arbitration

Arbitration is the last layer of dispute resolution on Bisq, available only if trader chat and mediation fail to produce a satisfactory outcome. Arbitrators have the third key in the 2-of-3 multisig escrow transaction, so their decisions are authoritative.

You can choose to engage an arbitrator upon receiving the mediator's suggested payout.

.If you disagree with a mediator's suggestion, you can engage an arbitrator.
image::engage-arbitrator-v116.png[.If you disagree with a mediator's suggestion, you can engage an arbitrator.]

Arbitration is meant to be rare. Arbitrators are required to respond to messages within 5 days, so it may take a bit longer for them to respond than mediators (you should still respond to messages within 2 days).

See the section below on <<#dispute-process-what-to-expect, what to expect>> when your case is handled by an arbitrator.

==== History and future of arbitration

Arbitration used to be the only way to handle disputes on Bisq. It was an imperfect but effective solution for the fledgling network. During this time, all trading fees went to arbitrators to compensate for their high availability, high risk, and high stakes (if they made a payout incorrectly, they were on the hook for making it right).

Historically, arbitrator roles have only been held only by people who consistently put significant effort into the project over long periods of time to warrant holding such an important responsibility. They're also relatively expensive roles and not scalable either (e.g., it's difficult to find highly-trusted people to arbitrate in other languages).

In short, they're the weakest link in the Bisq network right now.

Hence upcoming changes to the Bisq trading protocol in v1.2 with the move to 2-of-2 multisignature wallets. Arbitrators will lose their third key in multisig escrow wallets, drastically reducing their power. Mediators and chat will become the primary tools of dispute resolution, leaving arbitration as a last resort for rare occasions.

=== Dispute Process: What to Expect

When engaging with a mediator or arbitrator, you may be asked to provide various proofs of a payment transaction.

[WARNING]
====
Please note that the measures below are for real disputes, that is, when the very existence of a payment is disputed. Such cases are rare.

The vast majority of disputes on Bisq are minor mistakes or issues that don't require the measures below.
====

==== "Notarized" bank site

https://tlsnotary.org/pagesigner.html[PageSigner^] is a browser extension that allows users to "notarize" web pages, so that you can provide tamper-proof evidence that a particular website rendered particular information. This is helpful for Bisq buyers and sellers to prove whether they did (or didn't) send or receive fiat payments.

A buyer claiming to have made a payment needs to send proof that they transferred the correct amount with the correct reference text. A seller claiming to have _not received_ payment needs to show proof in the form of their transaction history (filtered by the offer ID, with trade period specified for time period).

PageSigner outputs a `.pgsg` file you can send to a mediator or arbitrator.

If it isn't possible to generate the required proof with PageSigner, the user will be asked to request a digitally-signed statement from their bank with evidence of their position.

NOTE: At this point, if there is no obvious resolution, both users will be asked to check with their banks to determine if the transaction was blocked or delayed by the bank. If it was, a mediator or arbitrator may allow the user more time to handle the issue with their bank.

**The following measures are even more rare, but we document them here just in case.** Fiat payment methods are tied tightly to identity, unfortunately, and if other payment verification methods fail, identity verification may be the only possible way to determine the veracity of two peers' claims.

==== Video ID verification

A mediator or arbitrator may ask the user to send a picture of themself ("selfie") holding scans of 2 government-issued IDs (front and back). At least one of the documents must include a photo.

If a user can produce such a photo, they may then be asked to have a video chat with both documents so the mediator or arbitrator can compare the photo on the IDs to the user's face on video.

Mediators and arbitrators are not required to reveal who they are.

NOTE: Remember—people in these roles have locked bonds to ensure their honesty, so knowing their identity isn't necessary. If you suspect foul play, know that <<user-dao-intro#ensure-honesty-in-high-trust-roles, confiscating their bond>> is a possible remedy.

If one peer fails to successfully verify themself, the case will be decide in favor of the other peer (assuming that peer _can_ verify their identity).

==== Video transaction verification

If both peers pass identity verification, the next step is to show a mediator or arbitrator the relevant bank account web page with evidence of the payment in question (or lack thereof) on a screen-share or video-chat.

==== Closure

Once a mediator or arbitrator has gathered enough evidence to make a decision, they will either suggest a payout (in the case of a mediator) or publish a new payout transaction (in the case of an arbitrator) from the 2-of-3 multisig deposit according to their findings.
