[NOTE]
.Example
====
If the best <<ask>> is **1,050 USD** and the best <<bid>> is **950 USD** and the <<market-price>> is **1,000 USD**, then the BTC/USD market spread is `(1050-950)/1000` or **10%**.
====

[TIP]
.Putting spreads to use
====
Spreads indicate different kinds of opportunities in a market. A 0% spread indicates an opportunity to trade at the market price. A positive spread (as in the example above) indicates an opportunity to make a better offer and to profit when your offer is taken more quickly than others. A negative spread indicates an opportunity to take an underpriced offer and to acquire bitcoin at a discount.

== Appendix: Notes and recommendations

 . Introduce 'Bid' and 'Ask' terms in the UI, API
 . Normalize presentation of market pairs, such that BTC is always the denominator, e.g. USD/BTC = 6,500 USD / 1 BTC; XMR/BTC = n XMR / 1 BTC.
   - UPDATE: kill the BTC entirely in most contexts. It's half of every trade. So just talk about Bisq's USD market, XMR market, etc. When displaying market prices, do it like this: `Market Price: 6552.50 USD/BTC`. Note how BTC is in the denominator here, as it should be. (currently we put it in the numerator of the market)
 . i.e. do not flip things around for altcoin / crypto trades. They're just another payment method as far as Bisq is concened. In Bisq, BTC is money. It's half of every trade. It's the unit of account. All prices here are denominated in it.
 . Change `Market` to `Markets` in top nav
 . Rename `Account` to `Payment Accounts`
   - Rename `National Currency Accouts` to `Fiat Payment Accounts`
   - Rename `National Currency Accouts` to `Crypto Payment Accounts`
   - Extract `Arbitrator Selection`, `Wallet Password` and other tabs to `Settings`
 . Rename `Funds` => `Wallet`
   - Rename `Receive funds` to `Receive BTC`
   - Rename `Send funds` to `Send BTC`
   - Rename `Send funds` to `Send BTC`
   - Rename `Reserved funds` to `Reserved Balance`
   - Rename `Locked funds` to `Locked Balance`
 . Rework `Asset` hierarchy to include fiat
   - Use emoji flags for national currencies?
   - Repackage to `bisq.{=>core}.asset`? (would reflect that physical separation of repo is for practical purposes, would allow nat'l / fiat currency implementations to live in bisq-core.
