_Payment methods_ are the different ways that buyers can purchase bitcoin from sellers in a Bisq trade. Offers to trade specify which payment method must be used, and both buyer and seller must have access to that payment method in order to complete the trade. National currency payment methods range from traditional bank transfers, to money orders by mail, to more modern services like Revolut and Uphold, while altcoin payment methods always involve transferring payment over that altcoin's blockchain.
