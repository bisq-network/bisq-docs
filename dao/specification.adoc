= Bisq DAO technical overview

NOTE: This is an updated and more compressed version of the https://docs.bisq.network/dao/old_specification.html[old technical specification] document. It is still work in progress and we are working to cover more details.

== BSQ token
BSQ is a colored coin based on Bitcoin. 1 BSQ is represented by 100 Bitcoin Satoshi.

The colored coin concept does not require OpReturn data but uses the transaction graph to determine if a tx output originates in either the genesis tx or an issuance transaction.

BSQ inherits all the transaction rules from Bitcoin and add some additional rules. Even BSQ transactions do not require OP_RETURN,  it will be used for certain specialized transactions (voting, compensation requests,...). Beside the ancestry to the genesis or an issuance transaction there is another important rule: the outputs are parsed in a way that the first outputs are interpreted as BSQ as long there is sufficient BSQ value available from the inputs. So the order of BSQ and BTC outputs is essential! For inputs the order is irrelevant. Any violation of those rules would make BSQ invalid. There are many more details which are not all covered in that document at the current state.

We use the Bisq P2P network as carrier for the content of content rich data like proposals or voting. The blockchain is used for time stamping that data. Both the P2P network data and the tx are linked together and are used for creating a network consensus.
BSQ is a result of blockchain related data and P2P network data.

== Infrastructure
The Bisq DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data as well as on data from the Bisq P2P network. Each Bisq application is verifying the rules of the DAO. The degree of trust to data delivered from other nodes can be determined by the user. Running a full DAO node requires to run bitcoind with RPC enabled. The DAO state can be rebuilt from the genesis transaction. The only remaining trusted entity are then the seed nodes which deliver the past P2P network data. As seed nodes are bonded risk for abuse is very limited. There are at the moment 8 seed nodes and all need to be in consensus about the P2P network data. The user can see the consensus in the application (DAO monitor).

=== Nodes
A user can decide to run the application as lite node or full node. By default it runs as lite node as that does not require any additional setup.

==== Full nodes
A fully validating BSQ node has the requirement to run a Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) node to provide the blockchain data for verification. The communication is done via RPC. The details about the https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.md[setup] can be found in the documentation folder of the source code repository.

The full nodes receive a notification from Bitcoin Core at each new block, scan the block for BSQ transactions and broadcast those to the Bisq P2P network. Every transaction with any BSQ input or output (issuance) is considered as BSQ transaction. The full node also listens to network messages from lite nodes which are requesting BSQ blocks from a certain block height. The full node sends back the list of all blocks since that requested height. The bandwidth requirements for that will depend on the number of BSQ transactions but rough estimations suggest that there will be no considerable issues. The Bisq seed nodes are used as full nodes since those are the first nodes to which a user gets connected and we can use the existing connection to transmit the additional data early at startup.

==== Lite nodes
Most users will likely operate in the lite node mode. They have to trust the seed node operators that they are not all colluding and holding data back. If at least one operator is honest the lite node can detect a conflict and would re-validate each block from the last snapshot or even from the genesis block. The UI will notify the user about conflicting data from seed nodes.

A lite node requests at startup from the seed node the missing BSQ blocks and then validates those blocks to achieve a local state of valid and unspent BSQ outputs. In case of chain splits it can be that one of the seed nodes is on another chain and conflicting blocks get propagated. This would trigger a re-validation of all blocks from the latest snapshot for the lite node. The last received block would be considered as the current state but the user get displayed a message that there are conflicts and it is recommended to wait for more than one confirmation before considering a BSQ transaction as valid. Only after all full nodes (seed nodes) have the same state again the lite node will exit the "warning" state. If the user waits for a sufficiently high numbers of confirmation (4-6) he will not risk that his validation was based on an orphaned chain and that he could become victim of a double spend.

=== Seed nodes
Seed nodes act as providers for P2P network data as well as filtered blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain for lite nodes. When a node starts it requests all P2P network data from several seed nodes.

=== External DAO monitor
Monitoring of DAO related data and infrastructure will be added to the https://monitor.bisq.network/[Bisq monitoring]. This should help us to spot any potential consensus or network conflict early.

It is still not deployed but will be integrated soon.

=== BSQ block explorer
The https://explorer.bisq.network/[BSQ block explorer] shows all BSQ transaction with some metadata (transaction type,...). It gives also some statistical data about the network. It is a very basic version at the moment and we are working on a more sophisticated version. Any BSQ transaction can be looked up in a normal Bitcoin blockexplorer as well but of course will lack any DAO related context. If looking up a BSQ addresses the user need to remove the `B` prefix so that the address is considered a valid BTC addresses.

== BSQ integration in Bisq
The Bisq DAO and BSQ are fully integrated into the Bisq UI. It comes with a BSQ wallet, UI for creating proposals and participating in voting as well as other DAO features.

=== Wallet
The Bisq application provides an integrated BSQ wallet with basic features for receiving and sending BSQ as well as a transaction history screen. The wallet is based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki[BIP 44] and uses https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md[registered coin type 142]. This provides extra protection against the risk that the BSQ wallet could be used accidentally as a BTC wallet (e.g. when restoring from seed words). To avoid that users need to backup 2 different seed words we use the same seed for both the BSQ and the BTC wallet though they are stored in different files. To avoid mistakes to mix up BSQ with normal Bitcoin we use a "B" as address prefix in the user interface. Internally that prefix does not exist, a BSQ address is a normal BTC address and the transactions are normal BTC transactions.

BSQ token transactions and balances are represented inside the application but there is also a web-based https://explorer.bisq.network/[BSQ block explorer].

A BSQ transaction is valid only after a blockchain confirmation. Though for better usability we allow spending of own change outputs. There is no risk involved by that as a user would render all follow up transactions invalid if he would try a double spend. Unconfirmed BSQ received from others are not spendable.

=== Application internal DAO monitor
Inside the application we maintain a hash chain of states and P2P network data. The overall DAO state gets hashed at each new block and contains the previous hash, thus forming a chain of hashes. If the last hash is right all the previous have to be correct as well. Each nodes receives the last 10 hashes from the seed nodes and compare it with it's local hash. If there is any conflict it shows a warning and request to rebuild the DAO state. At each new block each peer broadcasts its local hash to its neighbors. That way the node also receives hashes from normal peers. Similar to DAO states we maintain a hash chain for proposal and blind vote data. Those hashes are created only once per voting cycle at a relevant block height when it is expected that the whole network should have received all data.

There are valid cases when consensus could be temporarily broken. In case of a chain split node will have a different DAO state as the bitcoin block hash is part of the data and if 2 nodes are on a different chain they will have different block hashes.

In case some P2P network data was not distributed well in the network it could also lead to temporary conflicts of the relevant hash chains. A application restart should usually resolve that issue. If not rebuilding the DAO state will force reloading all P2P network data.

=== Snapshots
To avoid reevaluating at each startup the whole history we use a snapshot mechanism.

Every 20 blocks a snapshot mechanism gets triggered. The current state get cloned and kept in memory and if a previous clone exists the previous one will be persisted. At the next snapshot trigger event the latest clone will be persisted and a new clone will be cached again. That way the snapshot is always at least 20 blocks old.

The lite node requests the blocks since the latest snapshot only, so that will be usually max. 20-40 blocks. Just at the first startup when the lite node has only the snapshot shipped with the binary the requested blocks might consume a bit more bandwidth.

If we have monthly releases there would be about 4500 blocks in one months but even with that we expect not more than 1-5 MB of bandwidth to receive the initial blockchain data.

=== Snapshots shipped in releases
Each application release is updated with a recent snapshot version of the DAO state. This data will be used for new users who have not created their own snapshot yet. This saves new users to download the complete historical data and build all from genesis.

The user still can rebuild from genesis if he does not want to trust the developers that they have shipped a correct snapshot. Any discrepancy would be easily detected.

== Blockchain related data
One part of the DAO is based on Bitcoin blockchain data. We use the blockchain for time stamping purposes but transactions do not carry content rich data. Those are provided via the Bisq P2P network.

List of possible BSQ transaction types:

- Genesis tx
- Transfer BSQ tx
- Trade fee tx
- Proposal tx
- Compensation request tx
- Reimbursement request tx
- Blind vote tx
- Vote reveal tx
- Lockup tx
- Unlock tx
- Asset listing fee tx
- Proof of burn tx

Beside those valid transactions a transaction can be unverified, invalid or irregular.
Unverified is the default state for all unconfirmed BSQ transactions. Validation is done once a tx is confirmed.
Invalid transactions are transactions which have violated the validation rules. BSQ have been destroyed in such transactions.
Irregular transactions are transactions which are invalid with their intended use but have not destroyed their BSQ. An example is a proposal tx which got confirmed too late (not in proposal phase) and therefor is invalid as proposal tx, but the BSQ are still valid to be spend.

=== Genesis tx
We use BTC from our donation address to fund the input for the genesis tx. We will issue 3 657 480 BSQ which is equivalent to 3.65748 BTC. The amount of 3 657 480 BSQ is the sum of the 2 500 000 BSQ which we distributed as symbolic https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/2f194230e23459a9211322c4b1c182cf3f367086e8059aca2f8f44e20dac527a[testnet BSQ] to past contributors back in July 2017 and 1 157 480 BSQ contributors have earned since we started the https://docs.bisq.network/dao/phase-zero.html[DAO phase Zero] in October 2017.

The outputs are the BSQ addresses of all contributors who have contributed to Bisq before we start the DAO on mainnet. All outputs are by definition valid BSQ. The genesis tx is funded with the exact amount including the miner fee so there is no change output.

=== Transfer BSQ tx
To send BSQ to another address is a simple transaction without opReturn. It requires a BSQ input for the transferred BSQ
as well as a BTC input to cover the miner fee. The outputs are the receivers BSQ address, an optional BSQ change output,
and an optional BTC change output.

A transaction to send 10 BSQ could look like this:

- Input 1: 30.00 BSQ (BSQ sender)
- Input 2: 0.01 BTC (required BTC for mining fee)
- Output 1: 10.00 BSQ (BSQ receiver)
- Output 1: 20.00 BSQ (BSQ change output back to sender)
- Output 2: 0.0095 BTC (BTC change output)
- Mining fee: 0.0005

=== Trade fee tx
We are invalidating a small amount of BSQ for the trade fee payment. As the burned amount is used as miner fee and not
as a regular tx output we don't have the restriction with the dust limit of 546 Satoshi and can spend fees as small as 0.01 BSQ (equivalent to 1 BTC Satoshi). The fee is the difference of the BSQ input and the BSQ output.

- A BSQ trade fee payment tx could look like this (for a fee with 0.5 BSQ):

- Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 9.50 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.09950050 BTC change output
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00049950 BTC + 0.00000050 BTC or 0.50 BSQ)

So in that case we only use 9.50 BSQ of the 10.00 BSQ from the input. As the second output is spending more than the remaining 0.50 BSQ it is invalid as a BSQ output and we consider it as a BTC output. The remaining 0.50 BSQ which was not used in the first output will be used for the mining fee, thus reduces the mining fee which is paid from the BTC input (input 2).

=== Proposal tx
A proposal transaction contains an opReturn output which indicates the type as well as carries the hash of the
proposal payload data.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x10
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 20 bytes for hash of proposal payload

The hash is created from the bytes of the proposal payload with tx ID set to null using protobuffer serialization.
It is first hashed with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160 to get a 20 byte hash.

Example with a BSQ fee of 2 BSQ:
- Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 8 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.09952000 BTC change output
- Output 3: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00048000 BTC + 0.00002000 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Compensation request tx/Reimbursement request tx
Compensation request tx and reimbursement request txs are technically the same and are inheriting the propertied of a
proposal tx but have some additional requirements. They add a BTC output which will be interpreted as a BSQ output at the vote result phase in case the request got accepted by voting.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs BSQ issuance and miner fee
- Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output (BSQ input - fee)
- Outputs [1]: Issuance candidate output; before voted ok it is BTC afterwards newly issued BSQ
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Outputs [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:
1 byte for tx type: Compensation request tx: 0x11 / Reimbursement request: 0x12
1 byte for version: 0x01
20 bytes for hash of request payload

Example with a BSQ fee of 2 BSQ and requested issuance amount of 5000 BSQ:
- Input 1: 10.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 8 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.00500000 BTC (5000 BSQ after positive voting)
- Output 3: 0.09452000 BTC change output
- Output 4: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00048000 BTC + 0.00002000 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Blind vote tx
The blind vote tx contains the hash of the blind vote payload and uses the vote stake as input. The stake is blocked during that phase and is only unlocked by the vote reveal tx. If another transaction would spend the stake the blind vote would become invalid. The blind vote requires a fee in BSQ.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for BSQ fee + stake
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [1]: Mandatory BSQ output of stake
- Output [0-1] Optional BSQ change output
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x13
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 20 bytes for hash of encrypted votes

To create the encrypted votes we use following data:

- Secret key: 128 bit AES key.
- List of a tuple of proposal Tx IDs + vote, sorted by tx ID. Only valid proposals of current cycle are included.

We use protobuffer serialisation for the bytes which will be encrypted with the secret key.

Example with a BSQ fee of 2 BSQ and 7000 BSQ vote stake:
- Input 1: 8000.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 7000 BSQ / 0.00700000 BTC
- Output 2: 998 BSQ change output
- Output 3: 0.09952000 BTC change output
- Output 4: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.00048000 BTC + 0.00002000 BTC or 2 BSQ)

=== Vote reveal tx
The vote reveal tx consumes the stake output from the blind vote tx as only BSQ input. It does not require a BSQ fee.
In the opReturn data we add the secret key for allowing to decrypt our blind vote and a hash of the blind vote list to ensure consensus about the P2P network data used in voting. This hash will be used at the vote result to determine a majority in case different users would have a different list of blind votes which would lead to different vote results and therefor cause consensus failures.

- Input [1]: BSQ input -> stake output of blind vote tx
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [1]: BSQ output (unlocked stake)
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x14
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 20 bytes for hash of blind vote list
- 16 bytes secretKey

The hash of the blind vote list is using all blind vote payload data we have received in that cycle and sort it by blind vote tx ID.
The secretKey is the encoded byte representation of the secret key.

Example with 7000 BSQ stake:
- Input 1: 7000 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 7000 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
- Output 3: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Lockup tx
The lock tx can be use for locking up funds for a bonded role or for bonded reputation. A certain amount of BSQ will be locked for a defined lock time (in blocks). Only an unlock tx can unlock such locked bonds. Once the unlock tx is confirmed the lock time will be used to determined when the funds can be used in a normal transaction again. During that unlock time the funds must not be moved otherwise it would be invalidated. During the period when the funds are locked up or are in the unlocking state the funds can be confiscated by voting.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [1]: Locked up BSQ
- Outputs [0-1]: BSQ change output
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x15
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 1 byte for lockup reason (bonded role 0x01, reputation 0x02)
- 2 bytes for lock time (see: bisq.common.util.Utilities.integerToByteArray for encoding)
- 20 bytes for hash

The hash in case of a bonded role is created from immutable data of the bonded role. Currently we use hashCode but that should be changed to a cryptographic hash.
The hash for a reputation is derived from a salt. The salt is by default a random string as hex or can be any string defined by the user.

Example with locking up 4000 BSQ:
- Input 1: 6000 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 4000 BSQ lockup
- Output 1: 42000 BSQ change output
- Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
- Output 3: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Unlock tx
The unlock tx takes the lockup tx output and use the lock time encoded in the opReturn to determine the unlock time.
The BSQ output cannot be used in another tx until the lock time is over. During that time it is in the unlocking state.
Afterwards it is in the unlocked state and can be spent like any normal BSQ output.

- Input [1]: BSQ input from lockup tx lockup output (output index 0)
- Inputs [1-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [1]: BSQ unlock output
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee

Example with unlocking 4000 BSQ:
- Input 1: 4000 BSQ (from lockup tx output)
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 4000 BSQ unlocking/unlocked state
- Output 2: 0.09950000 BTC
- Mining fee: 0.0005 BTC

=== Asset listing fee tx
Used for paying the listing fee for an asset. The ticker symbol of the asset is used for the opReturn data to bind the tx to a specific asset.
If BSQ fee is more then the required mining fee we do not use a BTC input and add the remaining BTC to the BTC output.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for listing fee
- Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - fee)
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 20 bytes for hash of ticker symbol

We take the bytes of the ticker symbol as UTF 8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with a BSQ fee of 20 BSQ:
- Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 80 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
- Output 3: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

=== Proof of burn tx
A user can put the hash of a arbitrary string (pre image) into a proof of burn tx and burns the user defined amount of
BSQ. He can later use the pre image to proof to any party that he has created that hash. He can also sign any challenge
message and the challenger can verify that he is the key holder of the first input used in that tx.

- Inputs [1-n]: BSQ inputs for burned amount
- Inputs [0-n]: BTC inputs for miner fee
- Output [0-1]: BSQ change output (BSQ input - burned amount)
- Outputs [0-1]: BTC change output
- Output [1]: OP_RETURN with opReturnData and amount 0
- Mining fee: BTC mining fee + burned BSQ fee

OpReturn data:

- 1 byte for tx type: 0x16
- 1 byte for version: 0x01
- 20 bytes for hash of pre image

We take the bytes of the pre image as UTF 8 string and hash it with Sha256 and then with Ripemd160.

Example with 20 BSQ burned:
- Input 1: 100.00 BSQ
- Input 2: 0.1 BTC
- Output 1: 80 BSQ
- Output 2: 0.0997 BTC
- Output 3: OpReturn data
- Mining fee: 0.0005 (0.0003 BTC + 0.00020000 BTC or 20 BSQ)

== P2P network payloads
Proposals and blind vote data are published over the Bisq P2P network. They have to be published in the correct phase and cycle otherwise they are considered invalid. Each node listens to those messages and persists it locally. At startup each node received the missing data from the seed nodes. The corresponding tx ID is part of the data and is used to map the data to the transaction. The hash of the P2P network data is part of the opReturn data in the transactions. That way we can verify that the mapping of a tx to the data is correct in both directions.

=== Temporary proposal payload
During the proposal phase the user can add and remove proposals. For removing we use the public key which was added when publishing a proposal and verify with a signature if the remove attempt is coming from the same owner. This is the same model as we use in other P2P network data like offer payloads. The data has a time to life of 60 days and after that it will be removed from the local storage.

=== Proposal payload
There are several different types of proposals:

- Compensation request
- Reimbursement requests
- Proposal for changing a parameter
- Proposal for a bonded role
- Proposal for confiscating a bond
- Generic proposal
- Proposal for removing an asset

The proposal contains the tx ID of the proposal transaction. When creating the transaction we add the 20 byte hash of
the proposal data to the opReturn data of the proposal tx. As the tx ID would be part of the proposal data and cannot be
known before the tx is created we leave it empty and set it afterwards. That way we get a mapping in both directions and
can verify later that a proposal payload has a valid tx and the tx data matches the proposal data.

At the break after the proposal phase all nodes publish the proposal payload which uses the proposal from the temporary
proposal payload. This data is now immutable and will be used for voting.

=== Blind vote payload
Blind vote data are published when the user makes his blind vote tx and are managed the same way like proposal payloads as append only data.

== Governance
Governance happen in a periodic proposal and voting cycle. A cycle consists of distinct phases.

=== Phases
Phases are defined by block height. Each phase is separated with a break to avoid issues with reorgs.

Here are the phases and the initial duration values (they can be changed by voting):
 - Proposal phase (compensation requests,...): 3600 blocks, about 25 days
 - Break: 150 blocks
 - Blind vote phase: Approve/decline proposals: 450 blocks, about 3 days
 - Break: 10 blocks
 - Vote reveal phase: 450 blocks, about 3 days
 - Break: 10 blocks
 - Result phase: 10 blocks

The full cycle will last 4680 blocks which is about month if one block takes in average 10 min.

==== Proposal phase
Any BSQ stakeholder can publish a temporary proposal payload during the proposal phase. A own proposal can be also removed.

==== Blind Vote phase
A BSQ stakeholder can vote on any proposal with 3 options: accept, decline or ignore. Not voting on a proposal is same as ignore.
The user defines how much stake they wants to put into their vote. The higher the stake the higher the vote weight compared to other voters. Additional to the stake `merit` is added in case the user has earned BSQ in previous cycles by an accepted compensation request. The issued amount will be accumulated using an aging function. Each issuance lose linearly over time weight and ends after 100 000 blocks (about 2 years) with weight 0. The merit is automatically added to the stake and the sum of both is the vote weight.

When creating the blind vote tx the user also publishes the blind vote payload. We use the same linking of tx ID and payload hash to map them together.

==== Vote reveal phase
When entering the vote reveal phase each voter automatically publishes the vote reveal tx. There is no fee required for that transaction beside the miner fee. No P2P network data is published.

==== Vote result phase
With the vote result phase all nodes calculate the vote result on all proposals and apply the result to the overall BSQ state.
It uses the hash of the blind vote list from the vote reveal tx to determine the winning majority in case users had different p2p network payloads of blind votes. The majority is calculated by stake (not merit) of the voters. Only if at least 80% of the network has the same hash the cycle is valid, otherwise all proposals and requests are considered rejected.

A proposal is considered accepted if the required quorum and threshold are reached. Quorum is the min. amount of accumulated vote weight in BSQ which is required. Threshold is the relationship of accepted votes to total votes. It cannot be lower then 50.01%. Each proposal type has different quorum and threshold parameters which can be changed by voting.

In case a proposal data was not available it will be rejected. In case there are 2 accepted change parameter proposals for changing the same parameter to 2 different values we reject both as it shows there is a social consensus issue in the DAO.

=== DAO Parameters
There are many different parameters which can be changed by voting.
Trading fees, voting parameters (threshold and quorum) and durations of the phases and many more.

See the
https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/3854907c14357680038661c8153095a157efbc5d/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/governance/param/Param.java[Param class] for a complete list.

=== Bonded roles
All roles in the Bisq DAO which can potentially create severe damage are handled as bonded roles. To become a role owner one need to make a request for a bonded role and once accepted by voting they need to lock up the defined bond. The role only is considered active once the bond is locked up.

The required amount for the bond is defined in to https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/497e202420940372fa1a344f64d375eac710d299/core/src/main/java/bisq/core/dao/state/model/governance/BondedRoleType.java[BondedRoleType enum]. The unlock time is 110 days for all roles.

In severe cases the BSQ stakeholders can make a proposal for confiscating a bond. This will require a very high threshold in voting and is considered an exceptional case which hopefully never ever happens.

Most bonded roles are connected to environments which cannot interact with the Bisq DAO directly. E.g. The Github admin role cannot be revoked by confiscating the role owner as the Bisq DAO has no power over Github. The only exceptions are mediators and arbitrators which will be verified if they are valid bonded role owners before they can be used for a dispute resolution. This is not implemented yet and will be part of the new trade protocol update in the next months.

=== Bonded reputation
Similar to bonded roles a user can lockup a bond to proof reputation. There is no concrete use case in Bisq at the moment for that feature but we might use that in future for new forms of trade protocols which are based on bonded reputation.

=== Asset listing fee
Assets added to Bisq need to gain enough traders to reach a min. trade volume over a certain time period. Those parameters are part of the DAO parameters and can be changed by voting. If an asset does not reach that threshold it will be removed from the list of assets when creating an altcoin payment account or selecting the preferred currencies in the preferences. Anyone can pay a fee in BSQ to gain a free trial period where this requirements to reach a certain trade volume is lifted. Usually the coin issues will be in that role but it can be done by anyone interested to trade that asset. The fee is initially 1 BSQ per day of trial period and a min. of 30 days. The fee can be changed by voting.

If a asset got removed by a `Remove Asset Proposal` it cannot be activated by the listing fee anymore. Also already paid listing fee is lost in that case.

=== Proof of burn
The advanced feature does not have a concrete use but might be used in some future features.
Burning BSQ can also be used as a form or reputation. If one is willing to burn some money and can use that proof for other activities (e.g. securing a trade) they will be interested that this form of reputation by burning BSQ will not become pointless in case he was publicly proven as scammer. The user can proof that he was the originator of that transaction by providing the pre-image to a hash, which gets added to the opReturn data as well as he can sign any challenge message to proof he had funded that transaction. We use the EC key from the first input for the signature.




== Disclaimer

This document does not cover all details and cannot be used as basis for implementation fo BSQ features or for
creating self crafted transactions. The source code it the only real specification. It is NOT recommended to create
custom BSQ transactions as tiny mistakes can lead to destroyed BSQ. Bisq developers will not care about transactions
which might be valid with the current rule set but which have not been created by the Bisq application. In future
updates rules might become more strict and might break such externally created transactions. Requirements for backward compatibility will only consider use cases and tx structures created by the Bisq application.

Please note that currently it is not recommended to send BSQ to a hardware wallet. Handling the miner fee might cause invalidation of the BSQ funds or cause losses if precious BSQ is used to pay the miner fee. We will publish some instructions how to do that in a safe way in the next months.
