= Proposals

Proposals are a means for suggesting significant changes to Bisq Network software components, infrastructure and processes.

The Bisq DAO is a flat organization, with no command-and-control hierarchy available to make big decisions and carry them out. Usually this is not a problem, as most day-to-day changes happen without any need for organization-wide consensus. Certain kinds of changes, however, benefit from or even require it.

What's needed is a mechanism that allows any contributor to _propose_ a change, and all other contributors to _review_ it in order to arrive at an IETF-style rough consensus.footnote:[See link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus[]] _Proposals_ are that mechanism, and this document covers everything that participants need to know about the process.

== When to Make a Proposal

Proposals are for _significant_ changes in the Bisq network.

**What proposals are good for:**

 * Creating an entirely new Bisq component or making a significant change to an existing one
 * Changing something about the way contributors work together
 * Creating new roles
 * Adjusting DAO parameters (e.g., trading fees)

**What proposals are not good for:**

 * Smaller changes to existing components, infrastructure or processes, where a broad consensus of contributors is not required
 * Adding or changing payment methods

If you're not sure if you should make a proposal, you should probably avoid making one. Instead, float your idea with contributors first (typically, on Slack or GitHub) and get a feel for what others think. If you get positive feedback, you can steer the conversation toward how to implement the idea, which may involve making a proposal.

See further <<proposals#step-0-research, pre-proposal suggestions>> below.

== Infrastructure

=== GitHub

Proposals are managed as GitHub issues in the {gh-org}/proposals/issues[bisq-network/proposals] repository.

=== Slack

The `#proposals` Slack channel is available for discussion and notifications about proposal issue activity.


== Roles

=== Submitter

The contributor(s) who write a proposal, submit it to the DAO, and carry it through to completion.

**Submitters are 100% responsible for the success of their proposals.**

=== Reviewer

Other contributors who read, discuss, react, and vote on proposals.

**Any contributor _may_ review a proposal, but no contributor is obligated to do so.** This intentionally puts the onus on the submitter to ensure their proposal is relevant and well-written per the <<guidelines>> below.

=== Maintainer

The contributor(s) responsible for proposals <<infrastructure>> and <<process>>.footnote:[See link:roles.html#maintainer[]]

==== Role Issue

==== Role Team
:proposals-maintainers: {gh-team}/proposals-maintainers[@bisq-network/proposals-maintainers]

{proposals-maintainers} footnote:[See link:roles.html#team[]]

==== Duties

 * Enforce the proposals <<process>> detailed below.
 * Monitor communications on the `#proposals` Slack channel.footnote:[See link:roles.html#communication[]]
 * Keep this proposals documentation up to date.footnote:[See link:roles.html#documentation[]]
 * Write a monthly report on the proposals maintainer <<role-issue>>.footnote:[See link:roles.html#reporting[]]

==== Rights

 * Write access to the {gh-org}/proposals[bisq-network/proposals] repository.


== Process

=== Step 0. Research

Before you submit a proposal, **do your homework!**

 . Discuss your idea with other contributors to see if a proposal is worth submitting at all.
 . Search through existing proposals (both https://github.com/bisq-network/proposals/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+[open and closed]) to see whether something similar has already been proposed.
 . Notice which among those proposals have been accepted and rejected, and why.
 . Read this document to fully understand the proposal process and guidelines.

=== Step 1. Submit on GitHub

Create a new GitHub issue in the `bisq-network/proposals` repository containing the text of your proposal, written and formatted per the guidelines below.

You will also need to submit your proposal to the Bisq DAO (see below), but that's best done after feedback and discussion on the GitHub issue.

A maintainer will quickly review your proposal and will either (a) assign it to you to indicate your ownership and responsibility over it, or (b) close it and label it as `was:incorrect` if it does not follow the guidelines below.

=== Step 2. Discuss on GitHub

Once a proposal is submitted on GitHub, interested reviewers should read, discuss and https://help.github.com/articles/about-conversations-on-github/#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments[react] to the proposal as follows:

 - üëç: I agree with the proposal and want to see it enacted
 - üòï: I am uncertain about the proposal and I need more information
 - üëé: I disagree with the proposal and do not want to see it enacted

When reacting with a üòï or üëé, add a comment explaining why. If you don't, then don't expect your opinion to have much weight or get addressed.

If you do not understand or care about a given proposal, ignore it.

Use comments on the proposal issue to discuss, ask questions, and get clarifications. Take lengthy discussions offline to Slack or elsewhere and then summarize them back on the issue.

=== Step 3. Submit to the Bisq DAO

If your proposal gets favorable feedback on GitHub, you should submit it to the Bisq DAO for ultimate approval.

Aside from being the designated decision-making mechanism, the Bisq DAO exposes proposals to the broader Bisq community of contributors and users.

To do this, navigate to the `Governance` tab of the `DAO` panel and click `Make Proposal`. Choose your proposal type and complete the form.



=== Step 3. Evaluate

After the two-week review period is over, a maintainer will evaluate reactions to and discussions about the proposal and will close the issue with a comment explaining that it is approved or rejected based on whether a rough consensus was achieved.

Approved proposals will be labeled with `was:approved`. Rejected proposals will be labeled with `was:rejected`.

If rough consensus has not been achieved, e.g. because discussion is still ongoing, dissenting concerns have not been addressed, or the proposal has turned out to be contentious, the maintainer will indicate that they cannot close the proposal, and that it is up to the submitter to take next steps to move the proposal forward. If the proposal does not move forward after another two weeks, the maintainer will close and label it `was:stalled`.

If there have been no or very few reactions to a proposal after the two-week period, the maintainer will close it and label it as `was:ignored`.

=== Step 4. Enact

Assuming your proposal was approved, the next step is to actually enact the changes described in that proposal.


== Guidelines

Write your proposal in a way that makes it as easy as possible to achieve rough consensus. This means that **proposals should be as simple, focused, concrete and well-defined as possible.** Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your fellow contributors to understand and agree with you.

**Take full responsibility for your proposal.** It is not the maintainers' job, nor anyone else's, to see your proposal succeed. If people aren't responding or reacting to your proposal, it's your job to solicit that feedback more actively.

**Never assume that anyone other than yourself is going to do the work described in your proposal.** If your proposal does place expectations on other contributors, or requires them to change their behavior in any way, be explicit about that.

**Provide context.** Make a strong case for your proposal. Link to prior discussions. Do not make your reader do any more work than they have to to understand your proposal.

**Format your proposal in Markdown.** Make it a pleasure to read.

In general, **good proposals take time to research and write.** Every minute you spend clearly and logically articulating your proposal is a minute that you save other contributors in understanding it. This diligence on your part will be appreciated and rewarded by others' attention. Cheaply written, "drive by" proposals that waste others' time will be closed immediately as `was:incorrect`.
